# EpiphanyFun
EpiphanyFun app Front-end Angular/TypeScript/HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

## Project Description
“Epiphany-Fun!” is a website that gives you ideas on what to do when you don’t know what to do. With Covid being around and not being able to socially meet-up we all are out of ideas of what to do to to kill boredom and keep the little ones busy. You can choose whether you want to know some indoor activities or outdoor ones. You can even post your own ideas for others to see!

## Devlopment Process
The process for this project was based on Agile methodologies. We had daily stand-ups with our leader/instructor to discuss what we achieved the day before, the plan for today and any hurdles. I developed this project in 5 Sprints.
